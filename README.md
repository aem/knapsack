# Knapsack Solver
This is a Python solver for the traditional knapsack problem.

The premise of the problem is simple. Given a set of objects with given weights
and values, as well as a knapsack with a capacity "x", find the set of objects
that will maximize the value of the knapsack while keeping the knapsack's weight
under capacity.
